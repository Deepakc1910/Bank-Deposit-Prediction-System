# Bank-Deposit-Prediction-System
In the modern banking sector, predicting whether a customer will make a term deposit is crucial for optimizing marketing campaigns and improving financial services. Banks conduct marketing campaigns to attract potential customers, but inefficient targeting leads to wasted resources and lower conversion rates.

This project aims to develop a Machine Learning-based Bank Deposit Prediction System that analyzes customer data, past interactions, and marketing efforts to determine the likelihood of a customer making a term deposit. By leveraging predictive modeling, banks can optimize their strategies, focus on high-potential leads, and enhance customer engagement.

Key Features for Loan Approval Prediction:

age – Older individuals may have more financial stability.
job – Employment type can indicate income stability.
marital – Marital status may influence financial commitments.
education – Higher education levels often correlate with better jobs and income.
default – Whether the person has defaulted on past credit.
balance – The bank balance, indicating financial health.
housing – Whether they have a housing loan (may indicate existing debt).
loan – Whether they have any other personal loans.
campaign, previous, poutcome – Interaction history with the bank (not very relevant for loans but could help).
